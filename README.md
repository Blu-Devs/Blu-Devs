# Michael D.

I am Programmer and Games Developer born and raised in Manchester. Currently, a graduate from the University of South Wales, I am developing a varied range of **skills** across different projects. But, outside of work, if you can't find me catching up with friends and family you can find me surpassing my limits mentally and physically - some of these interests include:

- Fitness & Discipline 🥋
- Learning Languages
- Philosophy
- Reading 📖
- Music

## Current Endeavors 📍

As an advance towards my aspirations I am expanding my creativity and knowledge through what you may find me working on **currently**:

- **3D Modelling and Sprite creation** 
- **Frontend Development**🖥️
- **Developing Games/Packages (Unity)** 👾
