# Hello, my name is Michael but I usually go by Mike

Firstly, I am creative programmer and Games developer born and raised in Manchester. Currently, as a student at the University of South Wales, I am developing a varied range of [**skills**](https://github.com/Michael-Derbyshire/Blupanda/edit/master/README.md#current-endeavors) across different projects.

- Martials & Fitness 🥋
- Destroying people in video games (The best player to exist) 🏆
- Drumming 🥁
- Reading 📖
