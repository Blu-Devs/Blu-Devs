# The name is Michael but I usually go by Mike 🤝

I am Programmer and Games Developer born and raised in Manchester. Currently, as a Student at the University of South Wales, I am developing a varied range of **skills** across different projects. But, outside of work, if you can't find me catching up with friends and family you can find me surpassing my limits mentally and physically - some of these interests include:

- Martial Arts & Fitness 🥋
- Playing Video Games (The best player to exist) 🏆
- Drumming 🥁
- Reading 📖

## Current Endeavors 📍

As an advance towards my aspirations I am currently recording a [**Devlog**](https://twitter.com/BlupandaDevs) on twitter to track my progress as a games developer. I am expanding my creativity and knowledge through what you may find me working on currently:

- **3D Modelling and Rendering (Blender)** 🖥️
- **Machine Learning (C++, C#, Python)** 👾
- **Sprite Creation (Aseprite)** 🎥
- **Developing Games/Packages (Unreal, Unity)** :atom:
